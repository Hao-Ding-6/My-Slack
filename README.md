# My-Slack

- Built a Slack-like extensible peer-to-peer app supporting multiple users in creating chat channels and chatting with others.
- Implemented the backend web server using Golang to raise the server running speed and connected it to RethinkDB to store real-time messages of all users.
- Designed the frontend with React.js framework and styled the pages using Bootstrap.
- Used Web Socket to make the frontend communicate with the backend server.
